# NDSROM
Decompiles NDS ROM files, and converts them to common formats.

Basically, it extracts all the resources from a NDS ROM file to and converts them to more common formats. 




Btw, there's a project at https://github.com/pleonex/tinke that seems better put together than this one,
 but it doesn't convert the actual game code to something readable like this project hopefully will be able to do. 
Additionally, last I checked, tinke doesn't support extracting models or videos.
