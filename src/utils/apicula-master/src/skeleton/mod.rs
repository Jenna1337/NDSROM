//! Build a skeleton for a model.
//!
//! A brief review of how skinning works. The skeleton consists of a _tree of
//! joints_ and a _skin vertex_ for every vertex.
//!
//! Each joint in the tree has a local-to-parent transform. The composition of
//! the local-to-parent of a joint with its parent's local-to-parent transform,
//! and so on all the way up the tree is a the joint's local-to-world transform.
//! Example:
//!
//!      A       A's local-to-parent = a, B's = b, etc.
//!     / \      D's local-to-world = a c d
//!    B   C     D's world-to-local = d^{-1} c^{-1} a^{-1}
//!       /
//!      D
//!
//! A skin vertex consists of a list of influences, each influence containing a
//! joint that influences the vertex and a weight controlling how great the
//! influence is. The vertex's final position is determined by the skinning
//! equation
//!
//!     (vertex final pos) =
//!       âˆ‘_{influence}
//!         (weight) (pose local-to-world) (rest world-to-local) (vertex rest pos)
//!
//! See eg. section X in the COLLADA 1.4 spec for more details.
//!
//! In NSBMD models, this skeleton data has been compiled into an imperative
//! list of rendering commands. Example for the above tree:
//!
//!     multiply cur matrix by a
//!     multiply cur matrix by c
//!     multiply cur matrix by d
//!     store to stack slot 1
//!     ... later ...
//!     restore stack slot 1
//!     draw vertices for D
//!     etc.
//!
//! Our job here is to essentially reverse this procedure, reconstructing  the
//! skeleton data from this list of imperative commands.
//!
//! We do this by doing abstract interpretation of the rendering commands,
//! recording what symbolic matrix is in which slot at each point in time. So we
//! would know that slot 1 contained a c d, and we would then use that to
//! reconstruct a chain of joints A -> C -> D and use D as the joint for
//! vertices drawn after restoring stack slot 1.
//!
//! This is the simplest case. A more detailed analysis of the math is in
//! joint_tree.rs.
