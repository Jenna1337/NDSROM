//! Build the joint tree from the VertexRecord.
//!
//! Our problem is this: given the symbolic matrix M which is to be applied to
//! each vertex
//!
//!     V(p) = M(p) (vertex pos)
//!
//! (where the dependence is on the pose p, ie. the value of the object
//! matrices) determine a skin which has the same effect. That is, give the
//! folllowing data
//!
//! - a tree of joints
//! - for every joint j, a local-to-parent transform C[j](p), which is an
//!   SMatrix, the totality of which determine the local-to-world transforms
//!   A[j](p) by
//!
//!       A[j](p) = C[root](p) ... C[grandparent j](p) C[parent j](p) C[j](p)
//!
//! - for every vertex, a list of influences (w_i, j_i) where w_i is a number
//!   (the weight) and j_i is a joint
//!
//! such that when the skinning equation is applied
//!
//!     v(p) = ∑_i w_i A[j_i](p) A[j_i](rest)^{-1} V(rest)
//!
//! we have V(p) = v(p) for every pose p.
//!
//! If you had a tree of joints and you wrote down the possible M's you would
//! get you'd find either
//!
//!     (object) (object) ... (object)
//!
//! for vertices that are influenced by a single joint (and (vertex pos) should
//! be in the space of that joint), or
//!
//!     ∑ (weight) (object) (object) ... (object) (inv bind)
//!
//! for vertices influenced by multiple joints (and (vertex pos) should be in
//! its rest model-space position). The vast majority of matrices I've seen do
//! indeed have one of these two forms (and mostly the former).
//!
//! Let's work backwards and see what conditions need to obtain for us to go
//! from matrices to joints. First, an observation:
//!
//! CONSTANT LEAVES ARE SUPERFLUOUS:
//!
//! Suppose we have a solution where there is a leaf joint j with C[j]
//! independant of p. Then A[j](p) = A[parent j](p) C[j] so
//!
//!     A[j](p) A[j](rest)^{-1} =
//!     A[parent j](p) C[j] C[j]^{-1} A[parent j](rest)^{-1} =
//!     A[parent j](p) A[parent j](rest)^{-1}
//!
//! so for the purpose of skinning, we might just as well have used j's parent
//! instead of j in every influence. In other words, constant leaves are
//! superfluous. This manifests below in that we always factor off the longest
//! suffix that is independent of p from a CMatrix before building a joint for
//! it.
//!
//! Now, the solutions:
//!
//! SOLUTION WHEN M IS A (SCALAR TIMES A) CMATRIX:
//!
//! Write M as a scaled composition of SMatrices
//!
//!     M(p) = a M1(p) M2(p) ... Mn(p) K1 K2 ... Km = a M'(p) K
//!
//! where a is a scalar and  K = K1 ... Km is the longest suffix that does not
//! depend on the pose. Then by making a chain of joints j_1 -> ... -> j_n with
//! C[j_i] = M_i we can find a joint j = j_n with A[j] = M'.
//!
//! Then taking j to be the sole influence with a weight of a we get
//!
//!     v(p) = a A[j](p) A[j](rest)^{-1} V(rest)
//!          = a M'(p) M'(rest)^{-1} V(rest)
//!          = a M'(p) M'(rest)^{-1} M'(rest) K (vertex pos)
//!          = a M'(p) K (vertex pos)
//!          = M(p) (vertex pos)
//!          = V(p)
//!
//! SOLUTION WHEN M IS A SKINNING MATRIX:
//!
//! Suppose M(p) = ∑_i a_i M_i(p) K_i where K_i is the longest suffix of each
//! term that does not depend on the pose. Comparing to the skinning formula, we
//! try to interpret this where a_i = w_i, M_i(p) = A[j_i](p), and K_i =
//! A[j_i](rest)^{-1}. Indeed assuming that
//!
//! * (I) M_i(rest) K_i = 1, and
//! * (II) M(rest) = 1, or equivalently, assuming (I), ∑_i a_i = 1
//!
//! we get
//!
//!     v(p) = ∑_i w_i A[j_i](p) A[j_i](rest)^{-1} V(rest)
//!          = ∑_i a_i M_i(p) M_i(rest)^{-1} V(rest)
//!          = ∑_i a_i M_i(p) K_i V(rest)
//!          = ∑_i a_i M_i(p) K_i M(rest) (vertex pos)
//!          = ∑_i a_i M_i(p) K_i (vertex pos)
//!          = M(p) (vertex pos)
//!          = V(p)
//!
//! (There is additionally a trivial solution for M = 0 with an empty influence
//! list.)
//!
//! These are really the same solution for all cases, it is only the conditions
//! under which they apply that differ. The first says that the solution works
//! when M has one term without additional qualifiers and the second says it
//! works when M has >1 term as long as (I) and (II) hold.
//!
//! What should we do with "unusual" matrices that don't fall into any of these
//! cases? These are rare so we just use the same solution again, but we wil
//! give a warning.
